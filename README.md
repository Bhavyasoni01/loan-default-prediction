# 🏦 Loan Default Prediction System

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains an end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline designed to predict loan default probabilities. The model is trained on historical loan datasets and deployed as a scalable RESTful API.

Built with modern MLOps best practices, the project includes:

* Automated model training
* Experiment tracking with MLflow
* SHAP explainability visualizations
* Dockerized deployment
* CI/CD automation using GitHub Actions
* Model validation workflows

# 📊 Dataset Information

The project uses historical loan-related data containing borrower financial details and loan repayment status.

### Features Include:

* Income
* Credit history
* Loan amount
* Debt ratio
* Employment details
* Loan repayment outcome

> **Note:** Large datasets are excluded from version control. Place dataset files locally before training the model.

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

# 🧠 Model Training

Run the notebook or training scripts to build the model.

```bash
python validate_model.py
```

or open:

```bash
notebooks/loanDefaulter.ipynb
```

---

# 📈 MLflow Experiment Tracking

Start the MLflow UI:

```bash
mlflow ui --port 5000
```

Visit:

```text
http://localhost:5000
```

to monitor experiments, metrics, and artifacts.

---

# ⚡ Running the API

Start the FastAPI server locally:

```bash
uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

Swagger documentation:

```text
http://localhost:8000/docs
```

---

# 🐳 Docker Deployment

## Build Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t loan-default-api -f dockerfile.api .
```

---

## Run Docker Container

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name loan-api loan-default-api
```

API will run at:

```text
http://localhost:8080
